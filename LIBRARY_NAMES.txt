Notes on Library names
======================

If the default SSL Cryptography library is not suitable for use, it may be
necessary to override the path or name.

The way to do this depends on the OS.

On Linux/macOS, each library version is generally installed in a separate directory.
The following properties can be used to override the JNI and JNA locations respectively:
jni.library.path
jna.library.path

On Windows, multiple library versions may be installed in the system directory under a different name.
The following properties can be used to override the JNI and JNA file names respectively:
jni.library.name
commons.crypto.OpenSslNativeJna

For testing with Maven, these properties can be defined on the command-line:

Linux/macOs:
$ mvn ... -Djni.library.path=/usr/local/lib -Djna.library.path=/usr/local/lib ...

Windows:

> mvn ... -D"jni.library.name=libcrypto-1_1-x64" -D"commons.crypto.OpenSslNativeJna=libcrypto-1_1-x64" ...
